## What's New

- [Experimental serverless site](https://dahn-research.eu/nbsite/?path=https%3A%2F%2Fphilipmathieu.github.io%2Fsagemath-intro%2F)
- Added [basic notebook on variables](variables.ipynb)

## 0. Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

To run SageMath, activate the ```sage``` conda environment with (Linux, macOS, WSL):
